üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ all. Let me introduce myself:
I consider myself a curious person who likes to spend my free time learning new things, riding a bike and traveling. As you can guess by looking at the picture, cycling is a true passion for me. I ride since I was 4 and it helps me to feel healthy, to spend time with friends and to discover the nature. The picture was taken back in 2014 at the Spanish National Championship where I took the 9th position. What about the curiosity? In July 2020 I earned a master‚Äôs degree in Statistics for Data Science. Previously, from 2014 to 2018, I earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Aerospace Engineering. During my high school years, I knew that I wanted to study something related to mathematics and physics. The passion for planes and space together with the curiosity to know how they work helped me decide. During that time, I asked a math professor to give me programming classes. I really enjoyed them, and I looked for other fields related with math and programming. Data science combines them all and I decided to move to that field. I started learning statistics and machine learning with python and R on my own. Soon after, I got hired at a consulting firm. After almost a year, I started the master‚Äôs degree.
